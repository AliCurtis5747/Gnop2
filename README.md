Welcome to GNOP 2! It's PONG but with a bit more crust around the edges.
The lefthand paddle is the player's, the righthand one is the CPU's

Controls: 
Up Arrow - Move the Paddle Up
Down Arrow - Move the Paddle Down

Win condition:
Try and score as many points as you can, when the CPU gets a 4 point lead, you lose!

Quirks:
The ball speeds up as you rally. The faster it goes, the more likely it is to 'break' through your paddle. Try and score before it gets too fast!
